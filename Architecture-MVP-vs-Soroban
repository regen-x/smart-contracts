## RegenX Architecture: MVP vs Soroban
## Purpose of This Document

This document clearly distinguishes between:

What the RegenX MVP uses today

What Soroban smart contracts are intended for in future phases

Its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity for reviewers, contributors, and partners regarding which components are deployed, required, and relied upon versus those that are exploratory or post-MVP.

RegenX MVP Architecture (Stellar Classic)

The current RegenX MVP is built exclusively on Stellar Classic native primitives.

These components are deployed, required, and actively used in the MVP.

Core Ledger Primitives Used

1. Native Asset Issuance

Each clean-energy project is represented by a Stellar native asset

Issued by a project-specific issuer account

Distributed via standard Stellar accounts

On-chain balances represent economic ownership

2. Trustlines

Investors establish trustlines to project assets using external wallets

Trustlines are created and managed directly on the Stellar ledger

No contracts or intermediaries abstract this process

3. Protocol-Level Offers

Asset acquisition occurs via Stellar’s built-in orderbook and offer mechanism

Investors sign offer creation and execution transactions using their own wallets

Settlement is handled natively by the Stellar protocol

4. Wallet-Signed Transactions

All investment actions are signed by external wallets (e.g. Lobstr, Albedo)

RegenX does not custody private keys or sign on behalf of users

5. Horizon-Based Indexing

Ownership, balances, and transaction history are derived directly from Horizon

On-chain balances are the system of record for ownership

No off-chain shadow ledgers or mirrored databases

What the MVP Explicitly Does Not Use

Soroban smart contracts

WASM execution

Contract-based escrow

On-chain automation

DeFi primitives

Automated payouts or revenue logic

If all Soroban contracts were removed, the MVP would continue to function without impact.

Soroban Smart Contracts (Post-MVP / Future Phase)

Soroban smart contracts are not required for the current MVP and are not deployed or invoked as part of the SCF-funded scope.

Soroban is reserved for future automation and optimisation, once the core Classic-based workflows are validated in production.

Intended Future Use Cases

Soroban may be introduced post-MVP to support:

Milestone-based capital controls

Conditional release of funds based on verified project milestones

Escrow and capital-locking logic

Programmable holding of funds prior to allocation

Automated payout and revenue distribution

Rule-based distribution of cashflows or credits

Governance and permissioning extensions

Contract-enforced approval or voting mechanisms

These features are additive, not foundational.

They enhance automation but do not replace Stellar Classic primitives.

Deployment Status Summary
Component	Status	Required for MVP
Stellar native assets	Deployed	Yes
Trustlines	Deployed	Yes
Protocol-level offers	Deployed	Yes
Horizon indexing	Deployed	Yes
Soroban contracts	Not deployed	No
Design Rationale

RegenX intentionally uses Stellar Classic first to:

Minimise attack surface

Reduce audit and regulatory complexity

Deliver a production-ready, institution-grade MVP

Leverage Stellar’s proven strengths in regulated finance and real-world assets

Soroban is treated as a future enhancement layer, not a dependency.

Summary

The RegenX MVP runs entirely on Stellar Classic

Soroban is out of scope, inactive, and non-blocking

Architecture decisions prioritise clarity, compliance, and delivery certainty

This separation is deliberate and enforced in both code and deployment.
